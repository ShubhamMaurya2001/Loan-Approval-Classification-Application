| `person_income`              | Annual income in USD                                           | Float       |
| `person_emp_exp`             | Years of employment experience                                 | Integer     |
| `person_home_ownership`      | Home ownership status (e.g., rent, own, mortgage)              | Categorical |
| `loan_amnt`                  | Loan amount requested                                          | Float       |
| `loan_intent`                | Purpose of the loan (e.g., personal, education, medical, etc.) | Categorical |
| `loan_int_rate`              | Interest rate on the loan                                      | Float       |
| `loan_percent_income`        | Loan amount as a percentage of the person’s income             | Float       |
| `cb_person_cred_hist_length` | Length of credit history in years                              | Float       |
| `credit_score`               | Credit score of the person                                     | Integer     |
| `loan_status`                | Loan approval status (`1 = approved`, `0 = rejected`)          | Integer     |

> ⚠️ **Note:**
> The column `previous_loan_defaults_on_file` was **removed** due to **data leakage**, as it directly correlated with the loan approval decision, leading to artificially inflated performance.

## ⚙️ MLflow Integration Highlights

* Automatically logs:

  * Model parameters and hyperparameters
  * Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)
  * Confusion matrix and ROC curves
  * Model artifacts and serialized `.pkl` files
* Enables:

  * Comparing multiple model runs
  * Tracking tuning experiments (learning rate, depth, estimators, etc.)
  * Exporting best-performing model for deployment

🧩 **Example:**
`mlflow.xgboost.autolog()` used to track experiments seamlessly during model training.
